# 3.0 ‚Äì Install and Query Azure Monitor Logs (KQL)

## üß± Goal

Install required agents if needed and begin querying collected logs using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** via the Log Analytics Workspace.

---

## üìò Option 1: Azure Portal

1. Navigate to **Log Analytics workspaces > InsightScape-Workspace**
2. Click **Logs** under the left menu
3. In the **Query Editor**, run sample queries such as:

```kql
Heartbeat
| summarize LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated) by Computer
| order by LastSeen desc
```

```kql
Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| summarize AvgCPU = avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m), Computer
| render timechart
```

---

## üß∞ Sample Queries

### VM CPU Usage Over Time

```kql
Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
```

### Failed Logons (Windows Event Logs)

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize count() by Account, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```

---

## üíª CLI & PowerShell

> üîπ There is no direct way to query KQL from Azure CLI or PowerShell by default. You can:
- Use **Azure Monitor REST API**
- Use **az monitor log-analytics query** (Azure CLI extension)

```bash
az monitor log-analytics query \
  --workspace <Workspace-ID> \
  --analytics-query "Heartbeat | summarize count() by Computer" \
  --timespan P1D
```

> üîë Get Workspace ID with:
```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
  --resource-group InsightScape-RG \
  --workspace-name InsightScape-Workspace \
  --query customerId -o tsv
```

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

- [ ] KQL queries return data for VM/app
- [ ] Azure Monitor Logs UI is accessible from the workspace
- [ ] At least one custom query tested and visualized
